## OpenOS

My own DIY operating system. The virtual version (which is portable and runs on top of another OS), will be written in Python (for now), while the real version will most likely be written in Chirp!

## What is it?

This is a DIY OS. So what does that mean? Well, as the name suggest: `Do It Yourself`. That's right. Pretty much every feature, you need to develop yourself. We'll add some basic features for you to get started, such as a text editor, a console (Which as standard will be able to run `Python 3.7`, `C`, `CPP`, `Chirp`, `Open` & `JavaScript` code), and then a library for each of those language mentioned above (for you to develop it). Along with that we'll also create an accessible file system, but you need to make a display for it yourself.
